 CHANGELOG

    0.2.15  Text "lichtgestalter/CurveSimulator" added to video.
            Debugging-Code (especially for state vector calculation) moved to backup files in folder "debug".
    0.2.16  Lightcurve in video now contains all data.
    0.2.17  Calculates for each body how many video frames are needed to complete one orbit.
    0.2.18  Using Kepler's Third Law, calculates Period P from semi-major axis a and vice versa.
    0.2.19  Calculates the initial velocity of the primary body based on the principles of
            conservation of momentum and the center of mass motion.
    0.2.20  Correct handling of secondary stars
    0.2.21  Configfile errorproofing
    0.2.22  Example videos
                TIC470710327 (with hacked velocity correction)
                TOI-4504 / TIC349972412 (1 star, 2 transiting planets, 1 non-transiting planet)
    0.3.0   Limb darkening alternative models/parameters
    0.3.1   Check if ffmpeg is available
    0.3.2   Parameter output to JSON-File
            Transit times:
            T1, T2, TT, T3, T4, T14
            TT (Time of Transit): The time of minimum projected separation between the star and planet, as seen by the observer
            b (Transit Impact parameter): minimum projected separation at the time of transit, in stellar radii
                Bug Gefahr: der relative Radius bezieht sich auf den verdeckten Koerper? Das waere bei sekundaeren Eclipses wohl unerwuenscht
            T12 (Ingress) is the period when an exoplanet begins to cross in front of its host star. It consists of two parts:
                T1 Exterior ingress (first contact): The moment when the planet's disk first touches the edge of the star's disk.
                T2 Interior ingress (second contact): The point at which the entire planet has moved onto the stellar disk.
            T23 is called full transit
            T34 (Egress) is the period when an exoplanet exits its transit across the star. It also has two parts:
                T3 Interior egress (third contact): The moment when the planet's disk touches the opposite edge of the star's disk as it begins to exit.
                T4 Exterior egress (fourth contact): The point at which the planet has completely moved off the star's disk, concluding the transit.
            T14 is called total transit
            The accuracy of all transit times depends on the parameter dt, the real time difference between simulation iterations.
            By contrast the timestamps and luminosity values of the lightcurve minima have been slightly adjusted using quadratic interpolation.
    0.3.3   Improved orbit simulation using Verlet integration. Orbits are now numerically stable.
    0.3.4   Result files will no longer be overwritten. Instead, a new file with a running number will be created.
    0.3.5   Result file usage examples (result_evaluation.py)
    0.3.6   Postponed! state_vector_to_keplerian_elements
    0.3.7   Result output enhancements
                Angles are now stored in the result file not only in radians but also in degrees.
                Comment-Field in Config-File -> Result file, plots
                Depth of each transit added to result file
                TOI-4504 Research
                    Save plots
                    Sensitivity analysis:  What happens wenn parameters are changed + or - 3 standard deviations?
                        Checked for mass, e, i, P of planets c and d.
                        Checked for Omega and omega of planet c.
                        Result:
                            For some changes of Omega (e.g. +3 or +6 standard deviations) the decline
                            of planet c's transit durations is significantly delayed.
                            In each scenario, planets c and d have alternately longer phases with transits.
                     Manually extracted transit parameters (T1, T2, TT, T3, T4, depth) with high accuracy from TESS data.
    0.3.8 Artificial Star System
        Under which circumstances are planets alternately transiting?
            Larger and closer second planets with different inclinations change the inclination of the first planet faster.
            The effect changes somewhat smoothly with changing with increasing mass and decreasing distance of the second planet.
            This supports the thesis that the alternately transiting behaviour is real and not just an artefact.
    0.3.9 Result output enhancements
        More flexible result evaluation
    0.4.0 Constant energy check
        Added function energy() to check if the total energy in the star system stays constant as it should.
        Results:
            Precision: Error remains below ±2×10⁻⁷ relative to the mean (1 part in 5 million).
            Periodicity of error: Repeats about every 5,500 iterations (Δt=600 s per iteration) in TOI-4504
            This indicates a highly stable system with minimal energy drift over time.
    0.4.1 Fit simulation to d-Transits
        Planet d's mean anomaly adjusted in the config file until d's transit at 2460736.63 happens at the right time.
        But then the transit before was a whole day off (2460696.46 iso 2460695.53).
        -> postponed
    0.4.2 Trying out Rebound and other software
        N-Body programs:
            Exostriker: does not run correctly on Windows (had to rename python.exe, still had problems)
            Rebound: Excellent package. I consider using Rebound internally in Curvesim, replacing some of my own functions.
        Programs for estimating planet system parameters:
            Juliet: Project inactive?
            exoplanet: Project inactive?
            Exofast? Seems professionell. Doubtful if it works on Windows .
    0.4.3 Fitting TOI-4504
    0.5 Partial Rebound integration
        CurveSimulator now uses Rebound for integration and for calculating results (T1, T2, TT, T3, T4, depth, impact).
    0.5.2
         Searched with BoxLeastSquared after transits. Confirmed TOI4504b- and c-transits. No evidence for d-transits in sectors 1 - 69 :(
    0.5.3 MCMC
        Function corresponding_flux() converts TESS-data into data corresponding to a simulated lightcurve.
        Added cs_flux_data.py to CurveSimulator
        First rudimentary integration of emcee (MCMC library) with just one Parameter (Planet-b Period).
        Introduced silent mode (so Curvesimulator does not write into the console during MCMC)
    0.5.4 Flexible dt and intervals
        Now intervals can be defined, inside of which body positions and flux is recorded.
        Outside of these intervals the integration is calculated with a (potentially very large) default dt.
        This speeds the integration up significantly.
        dt can be set to different values in each time interval.
    0.5.5   MCMC integration, part 2
        MCMC can now change every parameter of every body (if it shall be fitted)
        CurveSimulator can now save a simulated lightcurve plus white noise as a csv-file.
        This file can be used as "measured" data to check if mcmc can generate meaningful results in this configuration.
        MCMC results and plots are now saved.
    0.5.6 Fitting TOI-4504
        MCMC uses multiprocessing now.
